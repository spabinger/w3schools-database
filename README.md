# Database

The sql scripts will create the following tables:

    categories
    customers
    employees
    orders
    order_details
    products
    shippers
    suppliers
    
You can use them
* W3 Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_editor
* Programiz: https://www.programiz.com/sql/online-compiler/
* Or install a database system on your local PC and import the database

Please answer the following questions
* Which customers had the most orders?
* On average how many products were included into an order?
* Which customer ordered the most Chocolade?
* Create a dashboard in your favorite tool (Tableau, Power BI, Excel) that shows the main KPIs of the data entries. What interesting facts can you come up with?
