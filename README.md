# Database

Hi!

in this study you will use your database skills to answer a few questions. Please follow the steps below. 

1. The repository contains two .sql files:
    1. *w3schools.sql* - A script to recreate the database structure used in w3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_editor)
    2. *programiz.sql* - Creates the w3schools database structure in programiz (https://www.programiz.com/sql/online-compiler/)
2. You have 3 options to work on the study
    1. Use **w3schools** (Online SQL Editor) - here the tables already exist and can be used
    2. Use **programiz** (Online SQL Editor) - here you have to import the tables and their content using either the *w3schools.sql* or *programiz.sql* file
    3. Use your **local, favorite** SQL tool - here you also have to import the tables and their content. For that you can download the .sql file.
5. The sql scripts will create the following tables:
    1. categories
    2. customers
    3. employees
    4. orders
    5. order_details
    6. products
    7. shippers
    8. suppliers
    
6. Once the database is ready to be used, please answer the following questions
    1. Which customers had the most orders?
    2. On average how many products were included into an order?
    3. Which customer ordered the most Chocolade?
    4. Create a dashboard in your favorite tool (Tableau, Power BI, Excel) that shows the main KPIs of the data entries. What interesting facts can you come up with?
  
7. Submit your answers in your preferred way
8. Result submission/presentation
    1. Presentation mode: Everything is allowed (surprise us and show us your innovative ideas)
    2. Result presentation language: English
    3. Submission: Either an Excel file, or screenshots showing dashboards in your favourite tool
